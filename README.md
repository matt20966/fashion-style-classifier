# fashion-style-classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify fashion items into three categories: casual, formal, and smart casual, based on images of various different fashion items.

For the development of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I used Google Colab to take full advantage of the available libraries and cloud computing resources. I recommend running the code in Colab, as it simplifies the process of importing the required libraries. However, Jupyter Notebook can also be used, though additional setup may be needed. The CNN model achieves an accuracy of 97%.
